    <h1>Body</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      body
      <em>[<a href="./../../operators/core/comparator.html">COMPARATOR</a>]</em>
      <em>[<a href="./../../operators/core/matchtype.html">MATCH-TYPE</a>]</em>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The body test matches content in the body of an email message, that
      is, anything following the first empty line after the header.  (The
      empty line itself, if present, is not considered to be part of the
      body.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The COMPARATOR and MATCH-TYPE keyword parameters are defined in
      [SIEVE].  As specified in Sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.3 of [SIEVE], the
      default COMPARATOR is "i;ascii-casemap" and the default MATCH-TYPE is
      ":is".
    </p>
    <p>
      The BODY-TRANSFORM is a keyword parameter that governs how a set of
      strings to be matched against are extracted from the body of the
      message.  If a message consists of a header only, not followed by an
      empty line, then that set is empty and all "body" tests return false,
      including those that test for an empty string.  (This is similar to
      how the "<a href="./../core/header.html">header</a>" test always fails when the named header fields
      aren't present.)  Otherwise, the transform must be followed as
      defined <a href="./../../operators/ext/bodytransform.html">on this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the transformations defined here do <em>not</em> match against
      each line of the message independently, so the strings will usually
      contain CRLFs.  How these can be matched is governed by the
      comparator and match-type.  For example, with the default comparator
      of "i;ascii-casemap", they can be included literally in the key
      strings, or be matched with the "*" or "?" wildcards of the :matches
      match-type, or be skipped with :contains.
