    <h1>Address</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      address 
      <em>[<a href="./../../operators/core/addresspart.html">ADDRESS-PART</a>]</em>
      <em>[<a href="./../../operators/core/comparator.html">COMPARATOR</a>]</em> 
      <em>[<a href="./../../operators/core/matchtype.html">MATCH-TYPE</a>]</em>
      <em>&lt;header-list: <a href="./../../atoms/core/stringlist.html">string-list</a>&gt;</em>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The address test matches Internet addresses in structured headers
      that contain addresses. It returns true if any header contains any
      key in the specified part of the address, as modified by the
      comparator and the match keyword.

      Like <a href="./envelope.html">envelope</a> and <a href="./header.html">header</a>,
      this test returns true if any combination of the header-list and key-list 
      arguments match.

      Internet email addresses have the somewhat awkward characteristic 
      that the local-part to the left of the at-sign is considered case 
      sensitive, and the domain-part to the right of the at-sign is case 
      insensitive. The "address" command does not deal with this itself, 
      but provides the ADDRESS-PART argument for allowing users to deal 
      with it.

      The address primitive never acts on the phrase part of an email
      address, nor on comments within that address.  It also never acts on
      group names, although it does act on the addresses within the group
      construct.

      Implementations restrict the address test to headers that contain 
      addresses. It is guaranteed to support at least From, To, Cc, Bcc,
      Sender, Resent-From, Resent-To headers.
