    <h1>Address Part</h1>
    
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      ":localpart" / ":domain" / ":all"
    </p>
             
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Addresses are one of the most frequent things represented as strings.
      These are structured, and being able to compare against the local-
      part or the domain of an address is useful, so some tests that act
      exclusively on addresses take an additional optional argument that
      specifies what the test acts on.
    </p>
    <p>
      These optional arguments are ":localpart", ":domain", and ":all",
      which act on the local-part (left-side), the domain part (right-
      side), and the whole address.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind of comparison done, such as whether or not the test done is
      case-insensitive, is specified as a comparator argument to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an optional address-part is omitted, the default is ":all".
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an error to give more than one of these arguments to a given
      command.
