    <h1>Match type</h1>
    
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      ":is" / ":contains" / ":matches"
    </p>
             
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are three match types describing the matching :  ":is", ":contains",
      and ":matches".  Match type arguments are supplied to those commands 
      which allow them to specify what kind of match is to be performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are used as tagged arguments to tests that perform string
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ":contains" match type describes a substring match. If the value
     argument contains the key argument as a substring, the match is true.
     For instance, the string "frobnitzm" contains "frob" and "nit", but
     not "fbm". The null key ("") is contained in all values.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ":is" match type describes an absolute match; if the contents of
     the first string are absolutely the same as the contents of the
     second string, they match. Only the string "frobnitzm" is the string
     "frobnitzm". The null key ":is" and only ":is" the null value.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ":matches" version specifies a wildcard match using the
     characters "*" and "?". "*" matches zero or more characters, and "?"
     matches a single character. "?" and "*" may be escaped as "\\?" and
     "\\*" in strings to match against themselves. The first backslash
     escapes the second backslash; together, they escape the "*". This is
     awkward, but it is commonplace in several programming languages that
     use globs and regular expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to specify what type of match is supposed to happen,
     commands that support matching take optional tagged arguments
     ":matches", ":is", and ":contains". Commands default to using ":is"
     matching if no match type argument is supplied. Note that these
     modifiers may interact with comparators; in particular, some
     comparators are not suitable for matching with ":contains" or
     ":matches". It is an error to use a comparator with ":contains" or
     ":matches" that is not compatible with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is an error to give more than one of these arguments to a given
     command.
