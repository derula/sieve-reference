    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Scripts involve large numbers of strings as they are used for pattern
      matching, addresses, textual bodies, etc.  Typically, short quoted
      strings suffice for most uses, but a more convenient form is provided
      for longer strings such as bodies of messages.    
    </p>
    <p>
      A quoted string starts and ends with a single double quote (the "
      character, ASCII 34). A backslash (the \ character, ASCII 92) is used
      as escape character. Thus the two-character sequence \\ represents a 
      single backslash or \" a doublequote within the string, respectively.
      Any other escape sequence (such as "\a" in a context where "a" has no 
      special meaning) is interpreted as if there were no backslash (in this 
      case, "\a" is just "a")
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-printing characters such as tabs, CR, LF, NUL (ASCII 0) and control 
      characters are permitted in quoted strings. Quoted strings may span 
      multiple lines.        
    </p>
    <p>
      For entering larger amounts of text, such as an email message, a
      multi-line form is allowed. It starts with the keyword "text:",
      followed by a linebreak, and ends with the sequence of a linebreak, 
      a single period, and another linebreak. In order to allow the message 
      to contain lines with a single-dot, lines are dot-stuffed. That is, when
      composing a message body, an extra '.' is added before each line which 
      begins with a '.'.  When the server interprets the script, these extra 
      dots are removed. Note that a line that begins with a dot followed by a 
      non-dot character is not interpreted dot-stuffed; that is, ".foo" is 
      interpreted as ".foo". However, because this is potentially ambiguous, 
      scripts should be properly dot-stuffed so such lines do not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a hashed comment or whitespace may occur in between the "text:"
      and the linebreak (CRLF), but not with comments are not allowed here.
